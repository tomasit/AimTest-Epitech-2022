Step 1 : Setup The Project

Create new project on version 2020+ with 3D module check.

Step 2 : Create your own character

First thing to do is to create a capsule3D gameObject, it will be your main character.
A gun prefab is provide on the repository, so take it and attach it to the character.
Last thing to do with our character is to attach a camera. Then take the Main Camera and attach it to your Player.
Try to setup your camera to have the better first person view render. 


Step 3 : Made your player moving

Create a c# script and attach it to the character, it will be usefull to manage the character movement.
A second script is necessary to move the camera with the mouse.

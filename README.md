# Step 1 : Create your own character

* Create a capsule3D gameObject, it will represent your main character main character.
* Take the gun provide on the repository, and attach it to the character.
* attach a Camera to your player to simulate FPS, try to setup your camera to have the better first person view render. 

# Step 2 : Made your player moving

* Create a c# script, and attach it to the character. This script will handle your character movement (take a look at Input documentation).
* Create another script, attach it to the camera, and made the camera follow the mouse mouvement (horizontaly but you can handle vertical follow if u want to).
* For a more realistic FPS change your movement script and try to always walk in direction of where you look.
